Deep-Learning-Based-Detection-of-Solar-Panel-Faults

Welcome to the **Deep Learning-Based Detection of Solar Panel Faults** project!  
This project uses deep learning techniques (ANN) to detect faults in solar panels using **sensor input data** (not images). It simulates fault scenarios and classifies them using a trained neural network.

🚀 Features

- Real-time solar panel fault detection
- Input: Sensor-based performance data
- Model: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- User interface built using Streamlit
- Fault categories: Normal, Short Circuit, Open Circuit, Shading, etc.

🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
